		<p class="col-md-12">
Living in today’s society as a young adult can be a challenging one. With the balance of going to school, working, maintaining healthy relationships with those around you, the list goes on and on; somewhere along the line you tend to break down. There are people that may either break down because life is too stressful, or it may be that their life isn’t going in the direction that they intend it to be. Another possibility could be that a person could be so involved but deep down they have this sense of loneliness and despair. In moments like these, many of us tend to turn to those material goods to try and replace these feelings. Whether it is drugs, alcohol, addiction to pornography, hanging with the wrong group of friends, these feelings of satisfaction or only temporary. We may think that these things will make us happy and fill all those empty feelings that we have inside. But honestly, at the end of the day you’ll feel that empty feeling inside you once again, and there are instances where that feeling might be even worse than the first time.
</p><p class="col-md-12">
We are so blinded with everything that society has taught us that we don’t even see what is in front of us. Instead of turning towards those things that can only provide temporary satisfaction, why not turn to the One that can fill that void in your life? And not just turn to him only when you need him, but realize that all you need is Christ. The theme of “In Christ Alone” sheds light and emphasizes how we need to turn away from sin and come home to God. “In Christ Alone” reassures that whatever it is that is making you feel empty, lonely or that void Christ will be the one that can mend those problems. At VYC 5 you will learn that Through Him, With Him and In Him there is nothing better than to bring all your troubles and worries with you and offer it up to the Lord so that “In Christ Alone” you will become renewed.
