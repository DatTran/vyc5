If you want to get involved just clone this repo. If you have not used github before, it is a good time to learn from good old Google.com

1. Install NPM, Grunt, Bower. You will need these
2. cd into your newly cloned directory
3. run 'npm install' to install dependencies
4. Then run 'grunt build' and if the bower_components folder hasn't been build yet run 'bower install'
5. Now to run a local server do 'grunt serve:app' to open up the /app application

When you want to contribute your changes do a git pull.
