			<h2 class="col-md-12">A Quick walkthough our history</h2>
			<p class="col-md-12">In 1984 at the International Jubilee of Youth, Pope John Paul II asked “Who claimed that today's youth has lost their sense of values?  Is it really true that they cannot be counted on?”  His questions inspired the launch of the well-known World Youth Day conference (WYD).
			Likewise, inspired by and in honor of Cardinal Nguyễn Văn Thuận who passed away in 2002, the Vietnamese Youth Convention (VYC) emerged a year later as a blend of the WYD platform infused with the Vietnamese culture and Catholic faith.  VYC is a three-day weekend-long spiritual gathering for youth and young adults from around the world to come together to share, learn, and celebrate their faith in Jesus Christ.
			Recognized as one of the largest Vietnamese American gatherings in the United States, VYC is hosted every three years and draws thousands of youth and young adults from many States and countries.  During this bi-lingual celebration of the Catholic faith, participants learn and share in workshops and seminars with dynamic religious leaders on topics relevant to the youth.  Topics has ranged from “Marriage and Family Life: Blessings and Changes” to “You fight, I fight, We ALL fight: Conflict Resolution, What Would Jesus Do?” to present day challenges “Linked? Networked? Friended? Texted? Let's Talk About Being Really Connected” and to more cultural specific “Làm Sao Con Biết? How Do I Know?”
			The workshops and seminars occur throughout the day and are intended to educate and inspire personal reflection leading to a call to action: to build a stronger Catholic identity, to create a closer relationship with Christ, and to contribute to the betterment of the Catholic community.  At VYC, participants have the opportunity to celebrate and strengthen their Catholic faith through fellowship with one another.  Participants also worship together through mass and musical concerts.
