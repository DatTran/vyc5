				<h3>Attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at VYC are required to agree with the following code of conduct & guidelines. Organization will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</h3>
			</div>
			<h2>Quick Version</h2>
			<p>
			VYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of VYC participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any VYC venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other online media. VYC participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the VYC organizers.
			</p>
			<h2>Long Version</h2>
			<p>
			Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
			</p>
			<p>
			Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the VYC organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of VYC staff immediately. VYC staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.
			</p>
			<p>
			VYC staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
			</p>
			<p>
			We expect participants to follow these rules at VYC and workshop venues and VYC-related social events.
